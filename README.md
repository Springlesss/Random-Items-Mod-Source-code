This is for educational purposes.

And thanks for downloading/checking out our mod... and coming to the github page.
You will see the whole folder for the mod here. With textures,code and soon custom behaviour written in C#.
I (Springles) also planned a little tutorial with tips and tricks that helped us during developing.

If you have friends playing the game, please consider telling them about RIM ;)

A Discord server is also work in progress (for suggestions) until then please send suggestions to Springles#5299.

Happy modding and learning....
