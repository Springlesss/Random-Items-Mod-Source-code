THIS IS NOT PART OF THE MOD

Im just gonna write about some things i did here. Also some tips and tricks.

First of all, dont feel bad about using snippets, they make your life just easier. Even though you copy paste some stuff.

When we look at the textures, some might already noticed that there are always 2 of them.
Thats because i named one completely normal, and the other ones with a "t" at the end. "t" stands for Thumbnail.

Also when we made some textures we learned some tricks.
We are using paint.net (https://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdn.html) to make all the textures.
When you start making  nail texture for example, first thing you wanna do is turn on pixel grid (https://imgur.com/a/t0gG3NS)
After creating it, you select the "Rectangle select tool" in your tool bar and mark it as tiny as possible. Copy it.
After that make a new canvas with the size 1x1, and press ctrl+v and paste it in. Click "expand canvas", it will automaticly correct the size to you texture.
